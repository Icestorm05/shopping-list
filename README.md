# Shopping List

This is a basic Shopping List app which was created with React and GraphQL.

## Install the Dependencies

The app requires you to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed.

After downloading the repository, open up a terminal and install the dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

## Running the App

To run the app in dev mode:
```sh
npm run dev
```

To run the app in prod mode:
```sh
npm start
```

In both cases, the app will boot up in parallel with the GraphQL server, and can be accessed by navigating to http://localhost:8080. The GraphQL server can be accessed at http://localhost:8081/graphql (Note: The backend UI is only accessable in dev mode).

To run the GraphQL server in standalone mode:
```sh
npm run server
```
